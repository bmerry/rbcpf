Rhythmbox Custom Playlist Format
================================
This is a Rhythmbox plugin that allows the format of the playlist sidepane to
be customized. For example, it can be used to show the genre instead of the
artist.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the entire directory tree to the Rhythmbox plugins directory. For
a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins.

Configuration
-------------
At present the new format is hard-coded into the plugin. Edit `rbcpf.py` to
change it.

Caveats
-------
Limitations in GTK+ make it impossible to completely deactivate the plugin.
After deactiviting the plugin through the API, it is recommended to close and
restart Rhythmbox.

This has only be tested with Rhythmbox 2.99, which uses Python 2. Your mileage
may vary with Rhythmbox 3.x, which uses Python 3. At a minimum you may need
to change the Loader in `rbcpf.plugin` from `python` to `python3`.
